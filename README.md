# Distributed Image
Distributed Image is a **parallel image processing system**, where the client divides an image into chunks, sends them asynchronously to a server, which applies a filter, and then returns the processed chunks for reassembly. This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Programming** course during the **2023/2024 academic year**, in the third and final year of the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering**.
